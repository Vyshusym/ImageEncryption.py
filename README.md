## Abstract

The proliferation of digital images across platforms demands strong protection against unauthorized access and tampering. This project presents a **Streamlit‚Äëbased application** that encrypts and decrypts images using **AES (via the Fernet implementation)** to guarantee confidentiality and integrity of visual data. We derive **32‚Äëbyte keys from user input** using SHA‚Äë256 and Base64 encoding, process images with Pillow, and provide a **user‚Äëfriendly interface** for secure image handling.

## Introduction

Digital images often carry sensitive information ‚Äî medical scans, financial documents, or personal photos. Without encryption, interception or modification can result in privacy breaches or data corruption. **AES** is a U.S. government‚Äëstandard symmetric cipher renowned for both security and efficiency. **Fernet**, from the Python Cryptography library, provides authenticated encryption built on AES, ensuring data cannot be tampered with undetected. **Pillow (PIL fork)** offers robust image I/O and manipulation, making it ideal for preparing data for encryption and reconstructing images after decryption.

## Methodology

### Requirement Analysis

* **Domains Considered:**

  * Healthcare confidentiality
  * Financial document security
  * Secure multimedia messaging

### Algorithm Selection

* **AES/Fernet:** Chosen for symmetric authenticated encryption; balances strong security with performance suitable for real‚Äëtime use.
* **Key Derivation:** SHA‚Äë256 hashing ensures a fixed 32‚Äëbyte key, then URL‚Äësafe Base64 encodes it for Fernet compatibility.

### Implementation

* **Language:** Python, for rapid development and rich library support.
* **Front End:** Streamlit for an interactive web UI with minimal code.
* **Image Handling:** Pillow to read, display, and save images.
* **Key Generation:** Custom `key_generate.py` uses `hashlib.sha256` and `base64.urlsafe_b64encode`.

```python
# key_generate.py
import base64
import hashlib

def to_url_safe_base64_32_bytes(user_input):
    if isinstance(user_input, str):
        user_input = user_input.encode('utf-8')
    hashed_input = hashlib.sha256(user_input).digest()
    url_safe_encoded = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(hashed_input).decode('utf-8')
    return url_safe_encoded
```

---

## Testing & Validation

* **Confidentiality:** Verified that encrypted output cannot be decrypted without the correct key.
* **Integrity:** Round‚Äëtrip tests confirm decrypted images match originals pixel‚Äëfor‚Äëpixel.

---

## Performance Optimization

* Buffered image operations via `io.BytesIO` to minimize disk I/O.
* Key derivation and encryption executed **in-memory** for speed.

---

## User Feedback & Iteration

* Added **sidebar warnings** and **success/error messages** for clarity.
* Integrated **download buttons** for both encrypted `.enc` files and restored image formats.
